## THIS IS WORDLE GAME
plz enter a five-letter word as you want in upper case or lower case the code will deal with that 
"i used upper func. will change the input from user to upper case"
include library (randome) to choose a different word each time from list
use nested loop first one to take the input (guess) from user for 5 times(i work on it to make one loop instead of two loops)
second one has if conditions to check letters
there is if condition to stop running the code if the word is correct
